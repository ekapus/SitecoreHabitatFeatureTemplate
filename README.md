# Sitecore Habitat Feature Visual Studio Template
There is a standard structure to Sitecore Habitat Feature Projects, and after creating a few (and blogging about it here: http://www.nttdatasitecore.com/Blog/2016/February/Building-Something-In-Habitat), I got tired of copying and renaming files. 

Because I'm a lazy programmer, I created a visual studio template to make my life, and my colleagues lives, easier. 

The src folder contains the source project that I used to create the template. The Sitecore Habitat Feature Visual Studio Template.zip file contains the template that can be installed in visual studio.
